# VHDL_BirthdaySequenceProject
This VHDL code was designed to display the birthday and an LED sequence of team members onto a Basys-3 FPGA board. Only one of a member's information would be shown at any one time. The info to display will depend on the current inputs to the board.

For this group project, I was responsible for developing the VHDL design code and XDC file. Other members were allocated responsibility for creating the VHDL testbench code and for carrying out testing, simulation and implementation. As well as this, our group was to create a 20-page report detailing our code and its implementation onto the Basys-3 board. For this, each member was responsible for writing up the sections that they took responsibility for.

In the report, I have created a description of how the VHDL design code works.
